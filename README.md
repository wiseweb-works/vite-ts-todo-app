## About The Project

**Vite TypeScript Todo App** is a fast and responsive todo application that helps users manage tasks efficiently. This project is built with **Vite** for rapid development and optimized builds, **React 19** for building the user interface, and **TypeScript** to ensure strong type safety. It also uses **TanStack React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching, and **Material UI** for a modern, user-friendly design.

### Features

- **Modern UI**: Styled using **Material UI 6** for a clean and consistent design.
- **State Management**: Uses **TanStack React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching.
- **Type Safety**: Entirely written in **TypeScript** for better maintainability and error prevention.
- **Task Management**: Easily add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes.
